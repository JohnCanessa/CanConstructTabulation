# CanConstructTabulation
Determine whether or not `target` can be constructed by concatenating elements of the `wordBank` array.

This is an exercise in the following YouTube video:

Dynamic Programming - Learn to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges

The problem is solved by using the tabulation approach for dynamic programming.

If interested in my comments and approach, I invite you to read the following
